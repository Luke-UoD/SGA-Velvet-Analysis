# Analysis directory for BS32011.

This directory should contain all your scripts, notes and outputs. 
As well as this README file it contains a .gitignore file which will 
exclude certain files from upload to git. These are typically large files 
that are the outputs of running the scripts and will just take up unnecessary space.

You should ensure that this directory is pushed to a suitable remote under your control (on Bitbucket or Github).
If you wish for staff to view these scripts/results easily then add them to your remote repository.
